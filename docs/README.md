## What this guide will help you with

1. Integrating a static website that uses standard BarkleyREI coding conventions into a Drupal 8 CMS.

2. Configuring a Drupal 8 CMS to a standard level of functionality to facilitate integration.

3. Assist in navigating an existing integration/install and adding functionality to it.

## What this guide will NOT help you with

1. Learning how to use the Drupal 8 CMS interface. If you want a primer on Drupal, check out the user guide on Drupal.org: https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html

2. General community best practices for Drupal 8 development. Except where applicable, this guide will only discuss integration using existing methods in previous BarkleyREI sites. There is no "theory" behind the described methods other than they work well for our needs. This document could be developed further in the future if a new method or approach is discovered and finds to be more useful.

3. Drupal 9
