I've been making websites professionally since 2009, and long before that as a hobby. 

I live in the South Hills/Clairton area south of the city with my wife Lauren and my son Benjamin.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow me on Threads. This site is mainly so I have a spot to put things that need a website or hosted on a server. I don't really blog or post much but I'd like to make this site a bit more useful in the future.
