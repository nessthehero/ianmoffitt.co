I've been making websites professionally since 2009, and long before that as a hobby. 

I live south of the city of Pittsburgh with my wife Lauren and my son Benjamin.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow me on Threads. This site exists so that I have a spot to put things that need a website or hosted on a server. I don't really blog or post much, but I'd like to make this site a bit more useful in the future.
