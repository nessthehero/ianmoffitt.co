## Using Icons

To refer to an icon, use the following syntax:

    <svg class='icon icon-ICON_NAME' aria-hidden='true'><use xlink:href='#icon-ICON_NAME'></use></svg> 
    
Replace ICON_NAME with the name of the icon from icomoon.

## Namespacing

Some CMS systems use `.icon` as a class in major functionality. To avoid this, namespace the icons with something like `foo-`. You can add the namespace by modifying the class prefix and class selector of the project in the settings on Icomoon.
